Includes classes that implement the Huffman Encoding Process, along with JUnit tests and some .txt files for testing. 

Classes: 




Test Classes: 
  FrequencyCalculatorTest.java tests the implementation of the algorithm that calculates the frequency of a character in a String. 
  FrequencyTableTest.java tests the implementation of the data structure that maps characters to their frequencies. 
  EncodingTableTest.java tests the implementation of the data structure that maps characters to their binary encodings. 
  EncoderTest.java provides tests for encoding a text file. Includes the process from input file through Huffman Tree encoding. 
  DecoderTest.java provides tests for encoding and decoding a text file. Includes the process from input file, through Huffman Tree encoding, back to the original string. 

How to run: 
  Run provided JUnit test cases. 
    DecoderTest.java is the most comprehensive display of the Huffman Encoding process. 
  To run with your own input file, run the HuffmanEncoding.java class and follow input prompts.
